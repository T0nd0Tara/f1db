# f1db
An rxjs learning exercise that uses sockets for data

## What's wrong with orelDB?
1. You have all of the data straight away, This beats the concept of rxjs, as the student question why is it even
   needed.<BR>By using sockets, we assure the data gets in a STREAM, and we never know how many more messages we will
get
2. OrelDB confuses the students with very complex unnecessary pipes
3. Formula 1 is cooler
